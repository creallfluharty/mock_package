To mock some_package:

$ equivs-control some_package # This creates a file named some_package

$ sed -i 's/Package: <package name; defaults to equivs-dummy>/Package: some_package/g' some_package

# to get the remote version (for compatibility)
# $ apt-cache policy <package> | grep 'Candidate: '

$ sed -i 's/# Version: <enter version here; defaults to 1.0>/Version: some_version/g' some_package

$ equivs-build some_package # This will create a package named 'some_package_some_version_all.deb'

$ sudo dpkg -i some_package__some_version.deb # This will install your package
